In CraftStudio, you need to export your model(s) or animation(s) in JSON format with these commands:

To export your model type:
>/export json model

**Models shouldn't have more than one block with the same name!**

To export your animation:
>/export json animation

**If your model has more than one block with the same name, weird result could happen with the animation!**

And don't forget to export the model's texture:
>/export texture
